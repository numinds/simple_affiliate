Simple Affiliate

The Simple Affiliate module hopes to give Drupal 8 site administrators the
ability to allow registered users to bring in more referrals and thereby
increasing the userbase.

Working.
The working of the module is very simple. A registered user will be able
to see a block with an affiliate link. The link will  have their userid
as referral id as the url component. These users can then share this
link to their target audience.

Any user that clicks on this link will have a cookie set in their browser
with the users unique id. If the user registers on the site with the cookie
still active, the new user account will be set as a referral to the account
of the person who shared this link.
